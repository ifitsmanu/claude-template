# Commit Changes

Prepare and commit the current changes.

## Steps
1. Run linter and fix issues
2. Run tests and ensure they pass
3. Stage relevant files (git add)
4. Write clear commit message following conventional commits:
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - refactor: code change that neither fixes nor adds
   - docs: documentation only
   - test: adding or fixing tests
   - chore: maintenance tasks

Format: type(scope): description

Keep commits atomic and focused.
